## Overview

A project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

This was my first time incorporating JS, CSS and HTML in one project. This challenge gave me great practice using the following:
- buttons
- css custom properties
- flexbox
- working with the DOM
- .display none and block


### Continued development

I want to begin working on using eventListeners instead of onclick. I also will continue working on using flexbox.
